Medivance is an organization from Google APAC Solution Challenge to make a medical solution. We are focusing in Hajj pilgrims who really have poor health.

That's our first step to begin the journey.

## Problem Statement

The recent annual Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia in June 2024 attracted a total of 1.83 million
pilgrims, 1.6 million of whom came from 182 other countries. The Hajj was held during the
peak of Saudi Arabia's summer when temperatures reached a record 51°C, and 1,301 pilgrims
died from heat-related illnesses reported by Saudi authorities. The unprecedented death toll has
been a concern for global public health authorities since the deaths occurred(McCloskey dkk.,
2024). According to the BBC, in addition to chronic illnesses, there are other factors that cause
pilgrims to die. These include extreme heat, overcrowded tents and sanitation problems,
transportation problems, and slow medical personnel (goodstats, 2024).

Mass religious pilgrimages like **Hajj** bring together millions of people from diverse nations,
age groups, and health backgrounds into a single high-density environment. This leads to
several healthcare challenges:

- **Limited real-time health surveillance** of vulnerable pilgrims, especially elderly or chronically ill individuals.

- **Fragmented or inaccessible medical histories**, making it difficult for health teams to perform rapid triage.

- **Delayed clinical response** due to the absence of predictive and early-warning systems.

- **Lack of personalized care pathways**, especially in low-resource or high-mobility settings like Mina, Arafat, or Muzdalifah.

- **High risk of infectious disease outbreaks, dehydration, cardiovascular events**, and heat-related illnesses without proactive monitoring tools.


## Solution Key Points
**MEDIVANCE** is an AI-powered health management platform designed to
protect and empower pilgrims during large-scale religious journeys. By combining wearable
health monitoring, medical history inputs, and predictive AI algorithms, MEDIVANCE:

- Collects and analyzes **pilgrims’ medical profiles** before and during the pilgrimage.

- Provides **real-time health alerts** through wearable-integrated devices.

- Generates **AI-based clinical predictions** and early warnings.

- Enables **direct communication** between pilgrims and health professionals.

- Supports **global health authorities and Hajj missions** in managing large-scale populations efficiently.

### Oportunities : 

- A globally scalable model for mass-gathering healthcare events, including **Hajj, Umrah, Kumbh Mela, or Arbaeen pilgrimage**.

- Contributes to **global health security** by enabling syndromic surveillance and early detection of health threats.

- Can integrate with national health systems and **international pilgrimage missions**, regardless of origin country.
